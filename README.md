# Overview

This project allows you to view up to date earthquake activity, from around the world, for the past 7 days. You have the option to view the earthquake activity with 3 different map layers and can click on each earthquake to view itâ€™s magnitude and duration. Major tectonic plates are also displayed on the map in red.

# Data

Up to date earthquake API data is pulled from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/

# Running Instructions

To run, you will need to open the index.html file in a web browser. This file references the style.css, config.js, and logic.js files located in the Static folder. The config.js file is not stored in the github repo as it contains a private API key.
